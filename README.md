# Eye Exercise

### Project Description

This exercise was meant to explore what is possible when HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together. It is a web page with two eyes, where the eyeballs follow the mouse movement.


### How to Run

You can download or fork this repository. To view the website you can open the index.html file in a browser of your choice. If you want to use the code you can edit it in a code editor of your choice.

### Roadmap
